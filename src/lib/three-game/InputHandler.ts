// This file will be deleted as its content is moved to InputController.ts
// If your build system or version control doesn't handle file renames + content changes
// well in a single step, you might need to manually delete this file after applying the changes.
// For the purpose of this XML format, providing empty content for deletion is not standard.
// Instead, the file path itself is removed from the "current files" list provided to the AI
// in subsequent turns if the AI indicates a rename/delete.
// The <file> tag for /src/lib/three-game/InputController.ts effectively replaces this.
